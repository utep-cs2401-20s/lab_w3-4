# Welcome to Lab W3-4
Welcome to your first assignment on GitHub Classroom!

## About the Repository
You will find the following files in your repository:
- `README.md` which you are currently reading
- `CS2401 Week 3-4-Arrays.pdf` which contains the instructions for your assignment

## About the Assignment
Your assignment is focused on building your skills in arrays. To do this, you will build [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Java. Make sure to follow the instructions provided in the included PDF document.

### Due Date
Your assignment is due Friday February 14 at 11:59pm. Remember that there is a lateness policy as well (refer to the included PDF document).

### How to Submit
We will take the final date of your latest commit as your submission date, so
- if your last commit is **before** the deadline, your submission will be considered **on time**.
- if your last commit is **after** the deadline, your submission will be **considered late** (see policy in included PDF document).

# How to Use Git
## Cheat Sheet in Piazza
There is a cheat sheet available to you in the [Piazza Resources](https://piazza.com/utep/spring2020/cs2401/resources) page. You will be using Git to submit your assignment by the deadline.<br />

## GUI or Bash/Terminal?
You are given the option to use Git via:
- the IntelliJ IDE, which does not require any terminal command inputs, or
- the Git bash/terminal, which does require terminal command inputs.<br /><br />
We leave the choice to you! But remember, it is always useful to know how to use Git in more than one way.<br />

## Where To Find Your Repo
Your repository will not show in your profile's repositories, because any repository we create belongs to us. To find your repository, visit [our GitHub Classroom](https://github.com/utep-cs2401-20s) page and search for your *GitHub username*.
